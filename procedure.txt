Install expected python version first 

https://www.python.org/downloads/ download and install it. 

Check it with : pyhton --version, this shows pyhton verison 2 which by default installed. 

So to cheak version 3.x.x we need to use : pyhton3 --version. 

now creating the env: 

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html - reference 

python3 -m venv "env-name" , this is with out " " and env-name you like. 

source env-name/bin/activate this will activate the env 

deactivate, this command will deactivate the env. 

The above process is for when you can install python version sucessfully, sometimes python cant be installed directly, then figure out how to install required pyhon verison.
